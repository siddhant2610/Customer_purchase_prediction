Customer Purchase Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing customer segmentation using machine learning techniques. The notebook includes data preprocessing, encoding categorical variables, training a Random Forest Classifier, and evaluating model performance.

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

Key Steps

1. Data Preprocessing: 
    - Dropping missing values.
    - Encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder.

2. Feature Selection:
    - Selecting features like Age, Gender, Item Purchased, Category, and Color.

3. Model Training:
    - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
    - Training a Random Forest Classifier on the training set.
